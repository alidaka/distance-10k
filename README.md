# Notes
Is there a better way to get a nice task runner?
`dotnet msbuild -target:push`

# Screens
- Landing page - overview of program
- List of goals
- Goal entry
- Signin
- Goal editing
  - Immutable updates, rather than edits

# Tasks
- Google oauth
- Goal entry

# Future
- Pull Strava/other data
- Profile pages
